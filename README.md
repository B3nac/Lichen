### Setup from source

I highly recommended creating a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

`python3 -m venv envname`

Once the venv is created source it in order to install the dependencies to that environment.

`source path/to/envname/bin/activate`

Install briefcase.

### Customize default settings

You can customize the default network and ethereum account with a `config.ini` file. If you don't have a `config.ini` file TheLootBoxWallet will use the first public address created as the default address.

Example `config.ini` file:

```bash
[DEFAULT]

network = https://goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc
default_address = your_public_ethereum_address
```
