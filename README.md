# TheLootBoxClient
TheLootBox local Ethereum account creation and contract interaction client that focuses on security.

### Features

- Account wallet credentials are stored encrypted and decrypted only when the client is in use and unlocked by the account key.

- Runs locally and interacts with TheLootBox contracts on the Ethereum blockchain inherently more secure.

- Makes it easier to create "loot bundles" more explaination on what those are later. :)

### Supporting development

If you would like to send anything to my ens name `b3nac.eth` it will be appreciated, but is obviously not required.

### In progress

- Setting up TheLootBox contract functions.

- Creating a docker image (this also adds another layer of security)

- Add setup instructions
