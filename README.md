### Install from .deb file release

#### Steps to install

- Download the deb file from the latest release.

https://github.com/TheLootBox-xyz/TheLootBoxWallet/releases

- Run the install command.

`sudo dpkg -i thelootboxwallet-release`

- Start thelootboxwallet from `/usr/bin/thelootboxwallet/start`.

### Setup from source (Updating)

I highly recommended creating a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

`python3 -m venv envname`

Once the venv is created source it in order to install the dependencies to that environment.

`source path/to/envname/bin/activate`

---

### Customize default settings

You can customize the default network and ethereum account with a `config.ini` file. If you don't have a `config.ini` file TheLootBoxWallet will use the first public address created as the default address.

Example `config.ini` file:

```bash
[DEFAULT]

network = https://goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc
default_address = your_public_ethereum_address
```
